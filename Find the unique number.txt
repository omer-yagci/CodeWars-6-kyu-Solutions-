Description:


There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

/*




function findUniq(arr) {
  
  const x = arr.filter((elm) => elm === arr[0]);
  const y = arr.filter((elm) => elm !== arr[0]);
  
  return x.length > y.length ? y[0] : x[0]
}
